                                    <p>The International School Science Olympiad (ISSO) is an online Olympiad conducted for classes 1-12. The exam will have Mock Tests and one Final Exam.
                                      Each student can attempt the Mock Tests upto three times. 
                                      The exam consists of multiple choice questions (MCQ type). The total time for the examination is 1 hour for classes 1 to 12.
                                      Unlike the tests at local and regional levels, ISSO provides a stronger hold of insight and judgement of scientific facts and the challenges ahead. A comprehensive report of a student’s individual performance, which will be provided after the results are evaluated, is divided into various categories that help the student assess his/her strengths and weaknesses.
                                      Please refer to the exam preparation section for better guidance,book recommendations and exam tips.<br><br>

                                      The exam will be divided into sections as follows: <br><br>
